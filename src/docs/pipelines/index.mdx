# Pipelines & Orchestration

SynqX treats data pipelines as strictly versioned objects rather than loose scripts. This section explains how pipelines are built, validated, and scheduled.

## 1. Visual Design (Visual Editor)

The SynqX Console provides a high-fidelity visual editor where you build pipelines by dragging **Nodes** and connecting them with **Edges**.

### Node Architecture
Every node in the DAG represents an instance of an **Operator**:
-   **Properties**: Each node stores its own configuration (e.g., table name, SQL script, API endpoint).
-   **Validation**: The backend validates node configurations against the operator's expected schema before saving.

### Directed Edges
Edges define the flow of data and control:
-   **Upstream/Downstream**: Nodes are topologically sorted by the backend.
-   **Data Passing**: Edges define which DataFrame iterators are passed from upstream nodes to downstream ones.

## 2. Immutable Versioning

Versioning is the core of SynqX reliability. You never execute a "Pipeline"; you execute a specific **Pipeline Version**.

### The Publish Workflow
1.  **Draft**: The user designs the workflow in the editor.
2.  **Snapshot**: Upon clicking "Publish", the backend creates a `config_snapshot` - a full, recursive JSON representation of the entire graph.
3.  **Validation**:
    -   **Cycle Detection**: Ensures the graph is acyclic.
    -   **Connectivity**: Ensures no nodes are orphaned.
    -   **Operator Validation**: Verifies all required fields for each node are provided.
4.  **Immutability**: Once created, a `PipelineVersion` cannot be edited. Any change results in a new version (e.g., v1 -> v2).

## 3. Advanced Scheduling

The SynqX Scheduler is a high-availability service integrated with the Celery worker cluster.

### Cron-Based Triggers
Pipelines support standard cron expressions (e.g., `0 0 * * *` for daily at midnight).

### Overlap Handling
SynqX manages execution overlap via the `max_parallel_runs` setting:
-   **Sequential**: Set to `1` to ensure only one run of a pipeline exists at any time.
-   **Parallel**: Higher values allow for concurrent processing of different batches.

### Scheduler Audit Trail
Every scheduling decision is logged in the `scheduler_events` table, providing full visibility into why a job was triggered or skipped (e.g., due to concurrency limits).
