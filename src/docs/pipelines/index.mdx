# Pipelines & DAG Orchestration

SynqX manages data workflows as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. This ensures clear data lineage, parallel execution opportunities, and predictable error handling.

## 1. The Visual Orchestrator

The SynqX Console features a premium visual editor for designing complex workflows.

### Node Configuration
Each node represents a functional step. Settings are validated against the backend operator schema in real-time.
-   **Identity**: Unique labels and descriptions for documentation.
-   **IO Mapping**: Direct binding to Connections and Assets.
-   **Logic**: Operator-specific parameters (SQL, Regex, Mappings).

### Parallelism & Layers
The engine automatically calculates the execution plan by grouping nodes into **Topological Layers**:
-   Nodes within the same layer have no dependencies on each other and are executed in parallel.
-   This optimizes wall-clock time for high-volume pipelines.

## 2. Integrity & Versioning

SynqX implements a strict "Snapshotted" versioning system to guarantee execution stability.

### The Lifecycle of a Pipeline
1.  **Draft State**: Active experimentation in the UI.
2.  **Validation**: Structural analysis to prevent circular dependencies or orphaned nodes.
3.  **Publication**: A permanent, immutable JSON snapshot of the entire DAG is recorded as a new version.
4.  **Rollback**: Previous versions remain accessible and can be re-published instantly to revert logic changes.

## 3. Reliability Controls

### Concurrency Management
Control resource contention using `max_parallel_runs`. This setting determines if overlapping schedules should run concurrently or wait for previous jobs to complete.

### Node-Level Resiliency
Configure individual nodes with specific failure handling policies:
-   **Retry Strategy**: Fixed delay or Linear backoff.
-   **Execution TTL**: Maximum duration before a task is forcefully terminated to prevent resource leaks.

### Dependency Resolution
SynqX ensures that data is only passed to downstream nodes once upstream ancestors have successfully reached a `COMPLETED` state.
