# Observability & Eventing

SynqX treats logs and alerts as first-class data citizens.

## Structured Logging

Unlike plain text logs, SynqX stores logs in structured tables for forensic analysis.

### `job_logs` & `step_logs`
-   `level`: Standard syslog levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).
-   `message`: Human-readable summary.
-   `metadata_payload`: A `JSON` field allowing operators to log rich context (e.g., specific batch IDs or data quality metrics).
-   `timestamp`: Precision UTC time.

---

## The Alerting Engine

The notification system is decoupled from the execution engine via the `Alert` schema.

### `alert_configs` table
Defines the rules for notification dispatch.
-   `alert_type`: `job_failure`, `job_success`, `sla_breach`.
-   `delivery_method`: `in_app`, `email`, `slack`, `webhook`.
-   `cooldown_minutes`: Prevents notification spam during retries.

### `alerts` table
The persistent history of notifications.
-   `status`: `pending`, `sent`, `failed`, `acknowledged`.
-   `recipient`: The target destination (Email or Webhook URL).
-   `acknowledged_at`: Tracks when a user dismissed the alert in the Console.

## Scheduler Forensics

The `scheduler_events` table provides an audit trail of why jobs were or were not triggered.
-   `event_type`: `triggered`, `skipped`, `paused`.
-   `reason`: Contextual info (e.g., "Overlapped with existing run" or "Pipeline disabled").
