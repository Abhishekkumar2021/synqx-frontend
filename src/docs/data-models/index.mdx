# Data Persistence Architecture

SynqX utilizes a highly structured relational schema to maintain the authoritative state of data pipelines, connections, and execution history. The models are implemented using **SQLAlchemy 2.0** declarative mapping, ensuring strict typing and comprehensive referential integrity.

## Logical Domains

The schema is partitioned into four primary logical domains:

### 1. Connectivity Registry
Manages physical system definitions and the logical assets contained within them.
-   **Connections**: Encrypted system configurations and auth parameters.
-   **Assets**: Abstracted data entities (tables, endpoints, files).
-   **Schema Versions**: Fingerprints of asset structure at specific points in time.

### 2. Pipeline Orchestration
Defines the structure and versioning of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
-   **Pipelines**: High-level workflow containers and scheduling configurations.
-   **Versions**: Immutable snapshots of DAG configurations.
-   **Nodes & Edges**: The functional vertices and data flow relationships of the graph.

### 3. Runtime & Execution
Tracks the lifecycle of asynchronous jobs and granular task progress.
-   **Jobs**: Distributed execution units triggered by users or the scheduler.
-   **Pipeline Runs**: Aggregated metrics and status for a single job execution.
-   **Step Runs**: Node-level telemetry (I/O throughput, duration, resource usage).

### 4. Observability & Forensic
Maintains the audit trail and real-time event history.
-   **Job & Step Logs**: Persistent records of internal engine operations.
-   **Alerts**: Log of sent and pending notifications based on system triggers.

## Architectural Mixins

SynqX implements standardized behavior across all models through a set of reusable mixins:

| Mixin | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AuditMixin` | Automatically tracks `created_at`, `updated_at`, and the associated `user_id`. |
| `SoftDeleteMixin` | Enables safe record removal via `deleted_at` timestamps, preventing data loss. |
| `OwnerMixin` | Enforces multi-tenant isolation by scoping queries to specific user identities. |
