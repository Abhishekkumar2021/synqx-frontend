# System Architecture

SynqX utilizes a decoupled architecture that separates the **Control Plane** (Metadata, Orchestration, Scheduling) from the **Data Plane** (Execution, Connectivity, Transformation).

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestration Layer (FastAPI)
The API layer serves as the central brain of the platform. It handles:
-   **Security**: RBAC and session management via OAuth2 and JWT.
-   **Metadata Management**: Version control for pipelines and asset registries.
-   **The Vault**: An application-layer encryption service (AES-256) that secures credentials at rest.
-   **DAG Compiler**: Translates visual graph definitions into executable logical plans.

### 2. Distributed Execution Engine (Celery)
The execution engine consists of stateless worker nodes that perform the heavy lifting of data movement.
-   **Task Dispatching**: Jobs are enqueued via Redis and picked up by available workers.
-   **Runtime Isolation**: Each step run operates within its own context, with enforced timeouts and resource monitoring.
-   **Dynamic Operator Binding**: Workers instantiate operator classes on-the-fly based on the node configuration.

### 3. Metadata Persistence (PostgreSQL)
A strictly typed relational store that maintains the authoritative state of all system entities.
-   **Immutability**: Historical versions are preserved indefinitely for audit and rollback.
-   **Telemetry Storage**: Persists detailed execution metrics, including records processed and duration.

## Data Flow Lifecycle

1.  **Definition**: A user designs a DAG in the Console UI.
2.  **Snapshot**: Upon publishing, a recursive JSON snapshot of the graph is captured.
3.  **Scheduling**: Celery Beat monitors triggers and dispatches jobs based on concurrency limits.
4.  **Execution**: Workers resolve credentials via the Vault, instantiate connectors, and stream data through the defined nodes.
5.  **Observability**: Real-time progress is streamed via WebSockets while logs are persisted for forensic analysis.
