# Connection Management

SynqX goes beyond simple connectivity. It provides powerful tools to discover what data is available in your sources and automatically infer its structure.

## Overview

The Connection Details page serves as the hub for exploring a data source.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
    <Card icon={<Search className="h-5 w-5"/>} title="Asset Discovery">
        Scan your database or API to find all available tables, views, streams, or files.
    </Card>
    <Card icon={<FileJson className="h-5 w-5"/>} title="Schema Inference">
        Analyze the data within an asset to generate a JSON schema automatically.
    </Card>
</div>

## Workflows

### 1. Connecting to a Source

<Steps>
    #### Create Connection
    Navigate to the **Connections** page and click "New Connection". Select your type (e.g., PostgreSQL, Snowflake) and provide credentials.

    #### Test Connectivity
    Click the **Test** button on the connection card to verify SynqX can reach the source.
</Steps>

### 2. Discovering Assets

Once connected, you need to know *what* data is available.

1.  Click on the connection name to open the **Connection Details** page.
2.  Click the **Scan for Assets** button.
3.  SynqX will query the source's system catalog (or equivalent) and populate the list of assets.

### 3. Inferring Schema

To build pipelines, SynqX needs to understand the data types.

1.  Expand an asset card (e.g., `public.users`) in the list.
2.  Click **Infer Schema**.
3.  SynqX samples the data and generates a versioned JSON schema.
4.  You can view the history of schema changes over time.
