# Connectors & Schema Intelligence

SynqX abstracts physical infrastructure into a three-tier hierarchy: **Connections**, **Assets**, and **Schemas**. This abstraction allows the engine to handle diverse data sources—from RDBMS to REST APIs—with a unified logical interface.

## 1. Connections: The Physical Layer

A `Connection` represents the physical infrastructure and the credentials required to authenticate with it.

### Security & The Vault Service
SynqX utilizes a dedicated **Vault Service** to ensure high-security credential management:
-   **AES-256 Fernet Encryption**: All sensitive configuration parameters (passwords, tokens, keys) are encrypted at the application layer before being persisted to the metadata database.
-   **In-Memory Resolution**: Decryption keys are never stored alongside encrypted data. Credentials are resolved in RAM only during the execution phase within the worker process.
-   **Connectivity Validation**: The system provides real-time health checks, allowing users to verify credentials and network paths instantly.

## 2. Assets: The Logical Layer

An `Asset` is a specific data entity within a connection. SynqX distinguishes between the **Display Name** and the **Technical Identifier**.

### Asset Identification Standard
To ensure consistency across heterogeneous systems, assets use two primary identifiers:
-   **Name**: A human-friendly display label (e.g., `Production Users`).
-   **Fully Qualified Name (FQN)**: The technical path used by the engine to locate the data.
    -   *SQL*: `schema_name.table_name` (e.g., `public.users`).
    -   *REST API*: The endpoint path (e.g., `/api/v1/orders`).
    -   *Files/S3*: The relative path or object key (e.g., `exports/daily_report.csv`).

### Automated Asset Discovery
The discovery engine can introspect connections to identify potential assets:
-   **Relational**: Scans system catalogs to find tables and views.
-   **Object Storage**: Iterates through bucket prefixes to identify dataset boundaries.
-   **APIs**: Maps pre-configured or discovered endpoints to individual assets.

## 3. Schema Intelligence: The Structural Layer

Every asset is "fingerprinted" via an automated **Schema Inference** process.

### The Inference Engine
1.  **Stochastic Sampling**: The engine retrieves a representative sample of records (default: 1,000).
2.  **Type Resolution**: Automatically maps native system types to a unified SynqX type system (String, Integer, Decimal, Timestamp, Boolean, JSON).
3.  **Versioning**: Generates an immutable `AssetSchemaVersion` representing the structural state of the data at a point in time.

### Drift Detection & Protection
SynqX calculates a unique `schema_hash` for every version. 
-   **Contract Enforcement**: Before execution, the engine compares the upstream physical schema with the expected version defined in the pipeline.
-   **Breaking Change Protection**: If structural drift is detected (e.g., a dropped column), the engine can trigger alerts or pause the pipeline to prevent downstream data corruption.
