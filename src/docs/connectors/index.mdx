# Connectors & Schema Intelligence

SynqX abstracts physical infrastructure into a three-tier hierarchy: **Connections**, **Assets**, and **Schemas**. This allows the engine to treat a PostgreSQL table, an S3 bucket, and a REST API with the same logical consistency.

## 1. Connections: The Physical Layer

A `Connection` contains the technical details required to authenticate with a system.

### Security & The Vault Service
SynqX implements a zero-trust credential strategy:
-   **AES-256 GCM**: All credentials (passwords, API keys, service accounts) are encrypted at the API layer before hitting the database.
-   **In-Memory Decryption**: Decryption keys are never stored in the database. Workers only decrypt credentials in RAM during the `RUNNING` phase.
-   **Health Checks**: The backend provides on-demand connectivity testing to validate credentials instantly.

## 2. Assets: The Logical Layer

An `Asset` represents a specific subset of data (e.g., a specific table or a specific S3 prefix).

### Automated Asset Discovery
SynqX can scan physical connections to populate assets automatically:
-   **RDBMS**: Queries `information_schema.tables` to find all available objects.
-   **Object Storage**: Scans bucket prefixes to identify distinct datasets.
-   **APIs**: Discovers endpoints defined in the connector configuration.

## 3. Schema Intelligence: The Structural Layer

Every asset in SynqX is fingerprinted via **Schema Inference**.

### The Inference Engine
1.  **Sampling**: The engine reads a small sample of records (default: 1,000).
2.  **Type Detection**: Automatically identifies data types (String, Integer, Timestamp, JSON).
3.  **Versioning**: Generates an immutable `AssetSchemaVersion`.

### Drift Detection Logic
SynqX calculates a `schema_hash` for every version. 
-   **Consistency Check**: Before a pipeline starts, it compares the current physical schema with the version used when the pipeline was designed.
-   **Breaking Change Protection**: If a mandatory column is deleted upstream, SynqX flags it as a breaking change and can pause affected pipelines to prevent data corruption.
