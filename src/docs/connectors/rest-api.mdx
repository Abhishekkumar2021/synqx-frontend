# REST API Connector

The **REST API Connector** is a production-grade interface designed to interact with any HTTP-based service. It handles the complexities of modern API interaction, including multi-tier authentication, dynamic pagination, and nested JSON normalization.

## Configuration

Connector settings are defined at the **Connection** level and can be overridden at the **Asset** level.

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://api.example.com/v1",
  "auth_type": "bearer",
  "auth_token": "YOUR_SECURE_TOKEN",
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "X-Platform": "SynqX"
  },
  "pagination_type": "limit_offset",
  "page_size": 100
}
```

### Core Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `base_url` | string | The root URL for all requests. |
| `auth_type` | enum | `none`, `basic`, `bearer`, or `api_key`. |
| `data_key` | string | Dot-notation path to the record array (e.g., `data.results`). |
| `pagination_type` | enum | `none`, `limit_offset`, or `page_number`. |

## Usage Patterns

### As a Source (Extraction)
Assets represent specific endpoints. The `fully_qualified_name` should be the endpoint path relative to the `base_url`.

-   **Asset FQN**: `/users` or `orders/search`.
-   **Incremental Loading**: Supports high-watermark filtering if the API provides a sortable field (e.g., `updated_at`).
-   **Schema Inference**: The engine automatically flattens nested JSON structures into a relational format for transformation nodes.

### As a Destination (Loading)
Data is transmitted as JSON payloads.

-   **Write Method**: Configurable per asset (`POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`).
-   **Batching**: Optimized for high-volume loading by grouping records into single HTTP requests if supported by the target API.
-   **Upsert Logic**: When the `upsert` strategy is selected, the connector utilizes `PUT` or `PATCH` based on the existence of a primary identifier.

## Advanced Features

### Dot-Notation Record Extraction
If an API wraps its data in a response envelope, use the `data_key` property to point the engine to the record array:
*   Response: `{ "meta": {...}, "data": { "items": [...] } }`
*   Config: `data_key: "data.items"`

### Adaptive Pagination
The connector automatically manages cursor or offset state across multiple batches to ensure complete dataset extraction without memory overflow.
