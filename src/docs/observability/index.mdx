# Observability: Glass Box Monitoring

SynqX provides "Glass Box" observability. You shouldn't need to check five different systems to know if your data is up to date or why a job failed.

## Real-time Notifications

The integrated alert system ensures you are always informed of critical system events as they happen.

-   **Live WebSocket Feed**: New alerts are pushed directly to the browser, updating the notification badge instantly.
-   **In-App Alerts**: A real-time toast and bell menu provide context for success and failure events.
-   **Interactive forensic**: Clicking an alert takes you directly to the log forensic for that specific execution.

## Execution Forensic

The **Jobs & Runs** interface is a deep forensic tool designed for root-cause analysis.

### High-Fidelity Logs
-   **Structured Metadata**: Logs capture complex JSON payloads for data-driven debugging.
-   **Line-Level Referencing**: Line numbers and level-based highlighting (ArgoCD style) make navigating millions of lines effortless.
-   **Live Tail**: High-performance auto-scrolling allows you to watch data move through the system in real-time.

### Forensic Filters
Quickly isolate the information you need:
-   **Status Overlays**: Instantly filter by `Success`, `Failed`, `Running`, or `Pending`.
-   **Pipeline Context**: Isolate executions belonging to a specific workflow to trace historical patterns.

## Alerting Engine

The `AlertConfig` engine allows you to define flexible rules.

### Scoping & Filtering
-   **Global Rules**: "Notify me if ANY pipeline fails."
-   **Scoped Rules**: "Notify the #revenue channel only for Finance pipelines with ERROR severity."

### Intelligent Suppression
To prevent "Alert Fatigue", SynqX implements adaptive cooldowns.
-   **Cooldown Period**: Configurable window (e.g., 60 minutes) during which identical alerts are suppressed.
-   **Status Deduplication**: Only the first failure or recovery event triggers a notification within the cooldown window.

### Delivery Methods
-   **In-App**: Real-time WebSocket notifications in the Console.
-   **Email**: Professional HTML templates for stakeholder reports.
-   **Slack/Webhook**: JSON payloads for integration with modern incident management stacks.
