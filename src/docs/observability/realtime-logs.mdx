# Real-time Forensic Stack

SynqX utilizes a high-performance WebSocket architecture to provide instantaneous visibility into system operations.

## Notification Feed

SynqX broadcasts system-wide alerts to authorized users in real-time.

- **Endpoint**: `ws://<host>:<port>/api/v1/ws/notifications/{user_id}`

**Event Payload:**

```json
{
  "id": 789,
  "type": "new_alert",
  "message": "Pipeline 'Daily Backup' Failed",
  "level": "error",
  "job_id": 101,
  "pipeline_id": 5,
  "created_at": "2023-10-27T10:05:00Z"
}
```

## High-Fidelity Job Logs

The production-ready **Job Log Viewer** streams execution data directly from the Celery worker engine.

### Connection Endpoints

- **Job Level**: `ws://<host>:<port>/api/v1/ws/jobs/{job_id}`
- **Step Level**: `ws://<host>:<port>/api/v1/ws/steps/{step_run_id}`

### Terminal Features

The log terminal is designed for high-volume forensic analysis:

1.  **Level Highlighting**: Automatic color coding for `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `SUCCESS`.
2.  **Line Anchoring**: Every log line is indexed with a persistent line number for team collaboration.
3.  **Auto-Scroll with Pause**: Intelligent scrolling that can be manually paused to inspect specific events without losing the live feed.
4.  **Forensic Search**: Highlight-integrated search that isolates critical log segments instantly.
5.  **Data Export**: One-click download of the complete raw log history for external analysis.
