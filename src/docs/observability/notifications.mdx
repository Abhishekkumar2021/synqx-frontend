# Alerts & Notifications

SynqX features a robust real-time notification engine that keeps you informed of critical system events as they happen.

## In-App Notifications

The notification bell in the top right of the Console is your central hub for activity updates.

### Notification Levels
- <Check className="inline h-4 w-4 text-emerald-500" /> **Success**: Triggered when a pipeline completes its execution successfully.
- <AlertCircle className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> **Failure**: Triggered when a pipeline fails due to configuration or runtime errors.
- <Info className="inline h-4 w-4 text-blue-500" /> **Info**: System maintenance and configuration updates.

### Interactive Alerts
SynqX notifications are fully interactive. Clicking on a job-related alert will navigate you directly to the **Forensic History** page, automatically selecting the relevant job and loading its logs.

## Push Notifications

SynqX uses WebSockets to push notifications to your browser instantly.

### Live Toasts
When an alert is triggered, a toast notification appears in the top corner of the screen. This allows you to stay informed even if the notification menu is closed.

### Badge Indicators
The notification bell features a real-time badge count that increments as new events occur.

## Configuration

You can configure which events trigger alerts in the **Settings** section.

1.  **Select Target**: Choose which pipelines should trigger notifications.
2.  **Choose Delivery**: Select delivery methods (In-App, Email, Slack).
3.  **Set Cooldown**: Configure suppression windows to avoid redundant alerts during retries.

## Technical Architecture

Notifications are managed by the `AlertService` in the backend and distributed via a Redis-backed WebSocket manager. This architecture ensures low-latency delivery and supports scaling to thousands of concurrent users.
