## Core Interface Elements

### 1. Command Palette (CMD+K)
The global search dialog is the heart of SynqX navigation. It provides:
-   **Instant Navigation**: Jump to any pipeline by name or description.
-   **Forensic Search**: Search for specific job executions by ID (e.g., `#123`) or status.
-   **Intelligent Loading**: Results are fetched in real-time with integrated visual feedback.

### 2. Live Notification System
The notification bell in the top navigation bar provides real-time updates:
-   **Instant Alerts**: Receive push notifications for pipeline success or failure via WebSockets.
-   **Direct Action**: Click on any notification to jump directly to the corresponding execution logs.
-   **Unread Tracking**: Visual badges keep you informed of new system events.

### 3. Forensic History & Real-time Logs
The **Execution History** (`/jobs`) has been designed for deep forensic analysis:
-   **Pipeline Filtering**: Isolate executions for a specific workflow.
-   **Status Quick-Filters**: One-click toggles to view only Success, Failed, or Running jobs.
-   **ArgoCD-Style Terminal**: A production-ready log viewer with line numbers, level-based filtering, and high-performance auto-scroll.

### 4. Connection Management
Manage and monitor your data sources with a few clicks:
-   **Full Configuration**: Edit existing connections (like PostgreSQL) to update credentials or settings.
-   **Connectivity Testing**: Real-time health checks ensure your credentials are valid before deployment.
-   **Asset Discovery**: Scan sources to automatically list and fingerprint data assets.

### 5. Premium Glass-Panel Aesthetic
SynqX utilizes a sophisticated design system:
-   **Adaptive Theming**: Seamless support for Light and Dark modes with semantic color mapping.
-   **Visual Depth**: High-quality backdrop blurs, subtle borders, and layered shadows create a modern, high-performance feel.
-   **Responsive Navigation**: A collapsible glass sidebar that provides more room for your workspace while maintaining accessibility.
