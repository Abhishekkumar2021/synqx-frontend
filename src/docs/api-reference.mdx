     -d "username=admin@synqx.dev&password=password"

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Use the Token
Include the received token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

- `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed or missing.
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource does not exist.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Something went wrong on our end.
