# The Command Palette

SynqX Intelligence features a powerful command palette that allows you to navigate the entire platform without leaving your keyboard.

## Accessing the Palette

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd> (Windows/Linux) from anywhere in the application to open the search dialog.

## Navigation Modes

The palette automatically categorizes results to help you find information faster.

### 1. Data Pipelines
Simply start typing the name or description of a pipeline.
- **Visual Cues**: Identified by the <Workflow className="inline h-4 w-4 text-blue-500" /> icon.
- **Action**: Press `Enter` to jump directly to the **Visual Editor** for that pipeline.

### 2. Forensic History (Executions)
Search for specific runs by their execution ID or current status.
- **ID Search**: Type `#` followed by the job ID (e.g., `#42`) to jump to a specific run.
- **Status Search**: Type "success", "failed", or "running" to see the most recent executions matching those states.
- **Visual Cues**: Identified by the <Hash className="inline h-4 w-4 text-primary" /> icon.
- **Action**: Press `Enter` to open the **Execution Forensic** panel for that job.

## Interactive Experience

- **Live Loading**: Results are fetched and filtered in real-time as you type.
- **Keyboard Control**: Use the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> arrow keys to browse results and `Enter` to select.
- **Deep Linking**: Selecting a job automatically updates the application URL, allowing you to share forensic links with your team.

## Best Practices

- **Quick Jump**: Use the palette to move between different pipelines while designing complex workflows.
- **Error forensic**: When you receive an alert, use the job ID to quickly pull up the logs and identify the root cause.
- **Status Monitoring**: Regularly search for "running" to get a quick snapshot of active system load.
