# Introduction

**SynqX** addresses the chaos of modern data engineering by enforcing structure, strict typing, and immutability on data pipelines. It is not just a job runner; it is a **Data Reliability Platform**.

## The Problem with Traditional ETL

| Traditional Approach | The SynqX Way |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scripts as Pipelines**<br/>Pipelines are often loose Python/SQL scripts that are hard to version and rollback. | **Pipelines as Code-Objects**<br/>Pipelines are stored as versioned DAGs (`PipelineVersion`). Every run is tied to a specific immutable snapshot. |
| **Opaque Execution**<br/>"The job failed" is often all the info you get. Debugging requires SSH-ing into workers. | **Deep Observability**<br/>Execution is tracked at the `Job`, `PipelineRun`, and `StepRun` levels with structured JSON logs and metrics. |
| **Silent Schema Drift**<br/>Upstream schema changes break pipelines silently or cause data corruption. | **Schema Intelligence**<br/>SynqX fingerprints assets (`AssetSchemaVersion`) and detects drift *before* it breaks the pipeline. |
| **State Management Hell**<br/>Managing "last_updated" timestamps manually in scripts is error-prone. | **Managed Watermarks**<br/>The engine handles incremental state (`Watermark`) automatically, ensuring exactly-once processing semantics. |

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Universal Connectivity
SynqX abstracts data sources into **Connections** and **Assets**. Whether it's a Postgres table, an S3 parquet file, or a Salesforce API endpoint, SynqX treats them uniformly.

### 2. Immutable Versioning
When you publish a pipeline, SynqX creates a `PipelineVersion`.
-   **Traceability**: You know exactly which configuration produced a specific dataset.
-   **Rollback**: Revert to a previous version instantly if a new deployment introduces bugs.
-   **Audit**: Every change is tracked via the `AuditMixin` (who, when, what).

### 3. Resilient Execution

The runtime is built for failure.

-   **Retries**: Configurable strategies (Fixed, Exponential) per node.

-   **Timeouts**: Prevent zombie processes from consuming resources.

-   **Live Forensic**: Real-time log streaming via the high-performance forensic terminal.



### 4. Command Center

SynqX provides a unified control plane for your entire data estate.

-   **Command Palette (⌘K)**: Instant access to pipelines, executions, and forensic search.
-   **Real-time Alerts**: Global WebSocket push notifications for immediate incident awareness.
-   **Security**: All resources are securely scoped and filtered by `user_id`.
