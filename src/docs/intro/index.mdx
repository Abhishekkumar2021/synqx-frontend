# Introduction

**SynqX** is a high-performance ETL orchestration platform engineered to handle complex data delivery with precision and deep observability. Unlike traditional script-based workflows, SynqX formalizes data movement as a series of versioned, immutable Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

## Design Philosophy

The platform is built on four architectural pillars:

| Pillar | Principle |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Immutability** | Pipelines are never edited in place. Every change creates a new, versioned snapshot, ensuring 100% reproducibility. |
| **Observability** | Granular execution tracking at the job and step level provides a "Glass Box" experience for debugging. |
| **Intelligence** | Automated schema inference and drift detection prevent structural changes from causing downstream corruption. |
| **Resiliency** | Built-in retry mechanisms, concurrency controls, and high-watermark state management ensure reliability at scale. |

## Why SynqX?

Data engineering teams frequently struggle with opaque failures, unversioned logic, and silent schema drift. SynqX resolves these challenges through:

### 1. Unified Logical Abstraction
SynqX abstracts diverse physical systems (Postgres, S3, REST APIs) into a consistent logical model of **Connections** and **Assets**. This allow developers to define logic once and apply it across different infrastructures.

### 2. Native Schema Intelligence
Every data asset is fingerprinted. The engine detects breaking changes in source systems before they reach your production data warehouse, enabling proactive incident management.

### 3. Real-time Forensic Orchestration
Utilizing a distributed worker architecture powered by Celery and Redis, SynqX streams execution telemetry in real-time. Engineers can monitor row-level progress and resource utilization via a modern, unified console.
