# Operator Reference

SynqX comes with a library of built-in operators.

## Common Telemetry
All built-in operators automatically capture the following metrics for the **Execution Forensic** logs:
-   `records_in`: Number of records read from the source.
-   `records_out`: Number of records successfully processed/loaded.
-   `execution_time_ms`: Precision duration of the specific node's execution.

## Extract (Source)

| Operator | Description | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PostgresSource` | Reads from PostgreSQL. | Incremental (Timestamp/ID), Full Load. |
| `MySQLSource` | Reads from MySQL/MariaDB. | Incremental, Binlog (CDC planned). |
| `SnowflakeSource` | Reads from Snowflake tables/queries. | Batch Export. |
| `S3Source` | Reads files (CSV, Parquet, JSON) from S3. | Prefix matching, File tracking. |
| `SalesforceSource` | Queries Salesforce Objects (SOQL). | Incremental, Bulk API. |
| `RestApiSource` | Generic HTTP GET wrapper. | Pagination, Auth handling. |

## Transform

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `FieldMapper` | Renames, drops, or casts columns. |
| `PythonTransform` | Executes arbitrary Python code (Pandas/Polars). |
| `SqlTransform` | Executes SQL on a warehouse (ELT mode). |
| `DbtRunner` | Triggers a dbt job or cloud run. |
| `Filter` | Drops rows based on conditions. |

## Load (Destination)

| Operator | Description | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PostgresLoader` | Writes to Postgres. | Insert, Upsert, Replace. |
| `SnowflakeLoader` | Writes to Snowflake. | COPY INTO, Merge. |
| `S3Sink` | Writes files to S3. | Partitioning, Compression. |
| `RestApiSink` | HTTP POST/PUT for each record/batch. | Batching, Rate limiting. |

## Utility

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `EmailOperator` | Sends an email notification. |
| `SlackOperator` | Sends a message to a Slack channel. |
| `TriggerPipeline` | Kicks off another pipeline execution. |
| `Sensor` | Waits for an external condition (file arrival, API status). |
